## Download

We currently donâ€™t provide the code as a standard library that can be easily installed. In future
versions, we will try to work on this and improve usability. For the moment, to use the code there is
no explicit installation involved. Just fork and clone the github repository from [here](https://github.com/zbarni/network_simulation_testbed)
