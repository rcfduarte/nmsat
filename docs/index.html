Neural Microcircuit Simulation and Analysis Toolkit (NMSAT)

NMSAT is a python package that provides a set of tools to build, simulate and analyse neuronal microcircuit models with any degree of complexity, as well as to probe the circuits with arbitrarily complex input stimuli / signals and to analyse the relevant functional aspects of single neuron and population dynamics. It provides a high-level wrapper for PyNEST (which is used as the core simulation engine). As such, the complexity of the microcircuits analysed and their building blocks (neuron and synapse models, circuit topology and connectivity, etc), are determined by the models available in NEST. The use of NEST allows efficient and highly scalable simulations of very large and complex circuits, constrained only by the computational resources available. The modular design allows the user to specify numerical experiments with varying degrees of complexity depending on concrete research objectives. The generality allows the same types of measurements and complex experiments to be performed on a variety of different circuits, which can be useful for benchmarking and comparison purposes. Additionally, the code was designed to allow an effortless migration across computing systems, i.e. the same simulations can be executed in a local machine, in a computer cluster or a supercomputer, with straightforward resource allocation.

Getting started

The code was developed primarily for personal use, as part of a PhD thesis due to the need to perform similar experiments on very diverse systems. The goal was to perform numerical experiments, covering a broad range of complexity, in a fully transparent and reproducible manner, while making efficient use of computing resources. The code is imperfect and under active use / development. Despite our best efforts, it is still prone to errors, particularly due to the strict specificities of parameters..

Dependencies / Requirements

Python 2.7
NEST version 2.8.0 or higher
numpy version 1.7.0 or higher
scipy version 0.12.0 or higher
scikit-learn version 0.18.0 or higher
matplotlib version 1.2.0 or higher
Optional (add functionality):

PySpike version 0.5.1
h5py version 2.2.1 or higher
mayavi
Installing

The code is currently available only in this GitHub repository. To use it, simply download the source or fork and clone the repository. To configure your system, source the configuration file

git clone https://github.com/
Setting system defaults

The defaults folder contains the ... Modify the defaults to suit your specifications.

Running an experiment

A numerical simulation/experiment is specified as a global parameter file, a complete script parsing the parameters and executing the experiment (primarily usefull for development/debugging) and a similar function that executes the same series of commands but can be executed directly from main as:

python main.py -f {parameter_file} -c {function_name} --extra {additional_parameters}
All the details and specificities of the experiment are determined in complex parameters files. The main computation function then parses the contents of these files and, following the specifications, assembles and runs the simulation, using the framework's modules to build, simulate, analyse and plot.

Storing and harvesting data

After an experiment is complete, all relevant information is stored in

Examples

Complete examples can be found in the examples folder.
